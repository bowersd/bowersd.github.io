I am a phonologist based in Arizona. I have experience helping build language resources for indigenous communities (Plains Cree and Odawa), and have publications treating the correct description of sonority driven stress and rhythmic syncope, as well as the formal language theoretic treatment of rhythmic syncope.

My research program fits within the Kiparskian paradigm: I seek to explain (at least some of) diachronic change through the architecture of synchronic grammar. My primary focus has been on the aftermath of rhythmic syncope,  where an unremarkable sound change (the reduction and loss of unstressed syllables from iterative feet) triggers far-reaching restructuring in the morphophonological grammar. Richard Rhodes' lexicographic work (published in 1985) provides clear evidence of rapid restructuring in Nishnaabemwin (an acutely endangered cluster of dialects of the Algonquian language Ojibwe).  My work has expanded the descriptive picture with comprehensive field data and opened the way to a formal language theoretic explanation for the phonological catastrophe.  See especially my 2019 paper in Phonology and my  work from 2019-2020 with Yiding Hao on the Academic Output page.

I have recently been following up on Kim McCone's 1985 insight that there was post-rhythmic syncope restructuring in Old Irish. Elliott Lash and I expect to make a paper available soon showing that rhythmic syncope was short-lived, basing the argument on models of when Latin loanwords entered Irish.

Building on my penchant for applying primary field data to theoretical questions, I did an acoustic study looking for correlates of stress in Gujarati, about which some theoretical arguments on sonority-driven stress had been made. My 2019 paper in Phonological Data and Analysis found no empirical support for the theoretical claims.

I am a collaborator on Alan Corbiere's Nishnaabe oral history project (I produce glossaries and lemmatization for the texts) and also support Mary Ann Corbiere and Rand Valentine's online Nishnaabemwin dictionary.

When I am not being an academic, I sometimes help film-makers and others create fictional languages (see the first season of the Syfy show Killjoys, and this short film). True extra-curricular interests include biofuel production and commuting by bicycle. Oh, and I dabble in programming (almost exclusively in Python) ... check out my Github site.
