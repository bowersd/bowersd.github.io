I am a phonologist based in Eugene, Oregon. I help build language resources for indigenous communities (Odawa/Nishnaabemwin), and I pursue empirical/formal investigations of topics in phonological theory. I also have background as a Quality Assurance linguist at Lionbridge/Telus AI. Also, see my coding at my [Github page](https://github.com/bowersd).

My primary focus is on explaining the aftermath of rhythmic syncope. In a nutshell, an unremarkable sound change (the reduction and loss of unstressed syllables from iterative feet) triggers far-reaching restructuring in the morphophonological grammar. Such restructuring can minimally be seen in [Nishnaabemwin](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/phonology/article/abs/nishnaabemwin-restructuring-controversy-new-empirical-evidence/2671061998D22F2B9FC81B78DAE42661?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=bookmark) and Irish, and this may be due to the nature of [phonological](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06464) [competence](https://repository.upenn.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/ad88b760-c451-47e6-84d6-aac391f61ac9/content). 

I must stress that I was not the first to observe post-rhythmic syncope restructuring. For Irish, Nishnaabemwin and East Slavic, there are published works highlighting these facts dating from the 1970's. Please see the references in my papers (or the more long-winded description of my work on the [About My Work](./about.md) page). I would like to gain a better grasp of the data in Irish and East Slavic sometime in this lifetime (or [Mojeno Trinitario](https://phondata.org/index.php/pda/article/view/2), [Southern Pomo](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/phonology/article/stratal-overgeneration-is-necessary-metrically-incoherent-syncope-in-southern-pomo/9498DCFEE0AD8B373FA4C526691C7427), Tonkawa, Macushi, Maga Rukai, etc.). If you want to team up, reach out!

[My work on Gujarati](https://phondata.org/index.php/pda/article/view/19) looked for acoustic correlates of sonority driven stress, but I could not find the reported correlates from impressionistic studies.

I am a collaborator on Alan Corbiere's Nishnaabe oral history project (I produce glossaries and lemmatization for the texts) and also support Mary Ann Corbiere and Rand Valentine's [online Nishnaabemwin dictionary](https://dictionary.nishnaabemwin.atlas-ling.ca/#/help).
