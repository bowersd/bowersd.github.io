I am a phonologist based in Arizona. I help build language resources for indigenous communities (Odawa/Nishnaabemwin especially, but also Plains Cree), and I also pursue empirical/formal investigations of topics in phonological theory.

My primary focus is on explaining the aftermath of rhythmic syncope. In a nutshell, an unremarkable sound change (the reduction and loss of unstressed syllables from iterative feet) triggers far-reaching restructuring in the morphophonological grammar. Such restructuring can minimally be seen in Nishnaabemwin and Irish, and I hypothesize that this is due to the nature of phonological competence. 

I must stress that I cannot be credited with first observing the empirical phenomenon of post-rhythmic syncope restructuring. For Irish, Nishnaabemwin and East Slavic, there are published works highlighting these facts dating from the 1970's. Please see the references in my papers.

My work on Gujarati looked for acoustic correlates of sonority driven stress, but I could not find the reported correlates from impressionistic studies.

I am a collaborator on Alan Corbiere's Nishnaabe oral history project (I produce glossaries and lemmatization for the texts) and also support Mary Ann Corbiere and Rand Valentine's [online Nishnaabemwin dictionary](https://dictionary.nishnaabemwin.atlas-ling.ca/#/help).

When I am not being an academic, I sometimes help film-makers and video game studios create fictional languages (see the first season of the Syfy show [Killjoys](https://www.syfy.com/killjoys), and [Copper Age](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3198208/?ref_=nm_knf_t2)). True extra-curricular interests include biofuel production and commuting by bicycle. Oh, and I dabble in programming (almost exclusively in Python) ... check out my [Github site](https://github.com/bowersd).
